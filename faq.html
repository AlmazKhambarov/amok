      What editors does it support?

      <p>
        Amok is a command line tool, so it is editor agnostic and
        works regardless of what editor you choose.
      </p>

      <p>There are <em>plans</em> for integration with various editors for a better editing experience, but this is pretty far in the future</p>

      <p>It should integrate easily into the build settings of your favorite editor however</p>
    </dd>

    <dt class="faq-question">
      What frameworks does it support?
    </dt>

    <dd class="faq-answer">
      <p>Amok is framework agnostic, if it runs on the client and
      does not get collected it can be re-compiled.
      </p>
    </dd>

    <dt class="faq-question">
      What does it mean if a script has been collected?
    </dt>

    <dd class="faq-answer">
      <p>
      A script can be collected by the virtual machine if it is a top to bottom,
      linearly executing script without any callbacks,
      for example, lets say we have a script called hello.js that contains the following source code.
      </p>

      <pre class="highlight"><code>console.log('hello world');</code></pre>

      <p>
      This sort of script would run from top to bottom, and because there are no callbacks or
      other code that is recurring, it gets collected by the runtime.
      </p>
    </dd>

    <dt class="faq-question">How is this different from live-reload?</dt>
    <dd class="faq-answer">
      <p>
      Amok does <em>re-compilation</em> of source code through the runtime, where-as live reload just does a simple page *reload* which is the equivalent of hitting the refresh button in your web browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        Doing re-compilation lets us edit our algorithms, event handlers and other types of closures while the application is running without having it restart no loosing state.
