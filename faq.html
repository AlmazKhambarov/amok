    <dd class="faq-answer">
      Amok does re-compilation of source code through the runtime, where-as live reload just does a simple page reload which is the equivilent of hitting the refresh button in your web browser.

      Doing re-compilation lets us edit algorithms, event handlers and other types of closures while the application is running without having it restart.
